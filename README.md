# Rental-car-service-program
I have done rental car service project (python program) in this project we are giving the car on rent for travel and tourism for 1 to 10 days and 1 day's charges will be 5000 per cars. This project is for beginner level only thanks.

Code:
first we have a form - customer will fill the form with the required details then we will show the total amount per select car -- (per car rent will be 5000).
If the customer is interested in renting a car, we will proceed for further processing.

We will also update the data in our server if all the cars are hired
